Provider Setup \u00b6 OGC currently supports AWS and GCP out of the box (more added soon). In order for OGC to connect and deploy to these clouds a few environment variables are needed.

Before starting \u00b6 A couple of things to keep in mind: All scripts are executed in order based on the filenames. It is recommended to create scripts with a numbered prefix, for example: - scripts/ - 01-install-deps - 02-configure-services There is a special reserved filename teardown , if this file exists it will only be executed during a removal of a node. This is useful for any cleanup actions that may need to be run, such as removing test users, un-enrolling from a service, etc. Writing scripts \u00b6 Scripts can be written in any language, it is up to you to configure the nodes so that any runtimes and library dependencies are met on the target node for your script to execute in. One way to accomplish this is to create 01-setup-env bash script: #!/bin/bash echo \"Installing python3 on ubuntu\" sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -qyf python3 sudo pip install sh Then in subsequent scripts, using python3 is available. For example, in file 02-run-cmd-in-python : #!/usr/bin/env python3 import sh sh . ls ( '/' ) sh . cp ( '-a' , 'mydir' , 'anotherdir' ) Templating \u00b6 OGC provides some additional capabilities through templating. Under the hood python-mako is used for the parsing. With templating, you have the ability to query the underlying database to gather node information, a couple of modules are already exposed in the templates context: Var Description db Exposes access to the database models such as db.Node and db.Actions session Database session manager that allows querying the database, for example, session.query(db.Node).all() env Environment variables are made available through this key, env['USER'] #!/bin/bash echo \"\" % for node in session.query ( db.Node ) .filter ( db.Node.tags.contains ([ 'sles' ])) : echo \"[ID: ${ node .id } ] Name: ${ node .instance_name } || Connection: ${ node .username } @ ${ node .public_ip } || Provider: ${ node .provider } \" % endfor echo \"\" The runtime environment is also available within the template context. In one example, we can export the following into our .env file and reference those in the templates: OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_VERSION OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_SHA OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_VERSION OGC_FLEET_URL OGC_FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN See the below example for downloading elastic-agent and enrolling it into a fleet server: #!/bin/bash <%namespace name = \"utils\" file = \"/functions.mako\" /> <% url = \"https://staging.elastic.co/%s-%s/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-%s-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\" % ( env [ 'OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_VERSION' ] , env [ 'OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_SHA' ] , env [ 'OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_VERSION' ]) %> ${ utils .setup_env() } ${ utils .install_pkgs([ 'nano' ]) } ${ utils .download(url, 'elastic-agent.tar.gz' ) } ${ utils .extract( 'elastic-agent.tar.gz' ) } mv elastic-agent- ${ env [ 'OGC_ELASTIC_AGENT_VERSION' ] } -linux-x86_64 elastic-agent cd elastic-agent && ./elastic-agent install -f --url = ${ env [ 'OGC_FLEET_URL' ] } --enrollment-token = ${ env [ 'OGC_FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN' ] } Reusable helpers \u00b6 In the above example we reference a file called /functions.mako this is just another template file that sits just outside of our defined scripts , for example, if our scripts is defined to be in scripts/my_ubuntu_deploy then this functions.mako will live at scripts/functions.mako . Alert This is good practice as you may have multiple layouts with different script directories for each and would like to store common functionality in a single place. Defining helper functions is straight forward, lets look at functions.mako for an example: ## Helper template functions downloading/extracting files <%def name = \"setup_env()\" > if ! test -f \"/usr/local/bin/pacapt\" ; then wget -O /usr/local/bin/pacapt https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/ng/pacapt chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pacapt ln -sv /usr/local/bin/pacapt /usr/local/bin/pacman || true fi </%def> <%def name = \"install_pkgs(pkgs)\" > % for pkg in pkgs: pacapt install --noconfirm ${ pkg } % endfor </%def> <%def name = \"download(url, src_file)\" > wget -O ${ src_file } ${ url } </%def> <%def name = \"extract(src, dst=None)\" > % if dst: mkdir -p ${ dst } tar -xvf ${ src } -C ${ dst } % else : tar -xvf ${ src } % endif </%def> Each %def section defines a function block that when called with any necessary arguments will output that data into the scripts with all necessary translations handled. You can see the usage of these functions in the previous example for installing elastic-agent.
