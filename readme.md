# OGC, a runner of things

ogc - Task runner with a focus on deployment/testing/reporting.

## Description

OGC is powered by plugins that can be discovered on https://pypi.org with the
prefix of `ogc-plugins`. With plugins installed different aspects of a run can
be defined through a spec file, which is a yaml file setting up plugin
configuration for the particular goal.

## Usage

```
> pip install ogc
> ogc --spec ogc-spec-runner.yml execute

# Or with a ogc.yml file in same directory running ogc from
> ogc execute
```

## Add plugins

To make *OGC* a bit more useful, install a few plugins:

```
> pip install ogc-plugins-runner
> pip install ogc-plugins-env
```

This will allow you to add functionality such as running scripts and preparing
environment variables. Please see the plugins section of the docs for more
information.

```yaml

meta:
  name: A test spec
  description: A simple spec showing how to run commands

# Phases
setup:
  - runner:    # This is the plugin from ogc-plugins-runner
      description: Clean out build directory
      cmd: rm -rf build
      tags: [clean]
```

### Show plugin dependencies

OGC doesn't install plugin dependencies automatically, but will give you a
summary that you can pass to whatever automation strategy you want.

```
> ogc --spec ogc-spec-runner.yml list-deps
```

Output:

```
Plugin dependency summary ::

  - apt:python3-markdown
  - snap:juju/latest/stable:classic
  - snap:juju-wait/latest/stable:classic
  - pip:pytest==5.0.1
```

To get the install commands for the plugin deps you can pass `--installable`:

```
> ogc --spec ogc-spec-runner.yml list-deps --installable
```

Output:

```
sudo apt install -qyf python3-markdown
sudo snap install juju --channel=latest/stable --classic
sudo snap install juju-wait --channel=latest/stable --classic
pip install --user pytest==5.0.1
```

Or to handle installing those packages automatically (like in a CI run):

```
> ogc --spec ogc-spec-runner.yml list-deps --installable | sh -
```
