## Example 1

```toml
[Juju]
# Juju module for bootstrapping and deploying a bundle
cloud = "aws"

# controller to create
controller = "validator"

# model to create
model = "validator-model"

[Juju.bootstrap]
# turn on debugging
debug = false

# disable adding the specified model, usually when some configuration on the
# models have to be done
disable-add-model = true

[Juju.deploy]
# reuse existing controller/model
reuse = true

# bundle to deploy
# bundle = "cs:~owner/custom-bundle"
bundle = "bundles/my-custom-bundle.yaml"

# Optional overlay to pass into juju
overlay = "overlays/1.15-edge.yaml"

# Optional bundle channel to deploy from
bundle_channel = "edge"

# Optional charm channel to deploy from
charm_channel = "edge"

# Wait for a deployment to settle?
wait = true

[Juju.config]
# Config options to pass to a deployed application
# ie, juju config -m controller:model kubernetes-master allow-privileged=true
set = ["kubernetes-master = allow-privileged=true",
       "kubernetes-worker = allow-privileged=true"]
```

## Example 2

Overriding the built in bootstrap command

```toml
[Juju]
# Juju module for bootstrapping and deploying a bundle
cloud = "aws"

# controller to create
controller = "validator"

# model to create
model = "validator-model"

[Juju.bootstrap]
run = """
#!/bin/bash
python3 validations/tests/tigera/cleanup_vpcs.py
CONTROLLER=$JUJU_CONTROLLER validations/tests/tigera/bootstrap_aws_single_subnet.py
"""
