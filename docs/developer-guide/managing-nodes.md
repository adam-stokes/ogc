# Managing Nodes Programatically

## Requirements

Accessing the functionality of OGC programatically requires that both cloud credentials and database access are configured. The environment variables for working with **AWS** or **Google** should be defined in your environment either by setting it in the `.env` or in the abscence of a dotenv file they can be exported by your current running shell.

Using the `.env` is easiest and is what we'll use for the remaining documentation, the following will configure access to both AWS and Google along with defining where our Postgres database resides:

``` sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="abbcc"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="sshitsasecret"
AWS_REGION="us-east-2"

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="mycreds.json"
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="bob@whodunit.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
GOOGLE_PROJECT="my-awesome-project"
GOOGLE_DATACENTER="us-central1-a"

POSTGRES_HOST="localhost"
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB="ogc"
POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="postgres"
```

## Database 

### Connect

Everything is tracked in the database, first thing to do is setup that database connection.

``` python
from ogc import db, state

if not state.app.engine:
    state.app.engine = db.connect()
    state.app.session = db.session(state.app.engine)
```

### Initialize Tables

Next, create the database tables, OGC provides a helper for this:

``` python
db.createtbl(state.app.engine)
```

Additionally, dropping the tables can be achieved this way:

``` python
db.droptabl(state.app.engine)
```

!!! caution
    If altering the database models make sure to perform migrations for users who upgrade OGC versions.

    First create the migration:

    ``` sh
    $ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "A new modification made"
    ```

    Next perform the migration

    ``` sh
    $ alembic upgrade head
    ```

    Or programatically:

    ``` python
    from ogc import db
    db.migrate()
    ```

    See [Alembic auto generating migrations](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html) for more info.

### Create User

A single user record is required in the database, this allows OGC to track cloud resources by certain tags associated with the OGC user.

To create an initial user:

``` python
from slugify import slugify

with session as s:
    has_user = s.select(db.User).first() or None
    if not has_user:
        user = db.User(name="adam", slug=slugify(name))
        s.add(user)
        s.commit()
        return
    print("User exists, nothing to do here")
```

Querying the database uses standard [SQLAlchemy](https://sqlalchemy.org), please reference that site for additional information.

## Nodes

Once the database is setup in your code, you are ready to begin creating and managing nodes. OGC provides both synchronous and asynchronous support depending on your needs.

### Launch Node

To launch a node an OGC specification is required with at least one [layout](../user-guide/defining-layouts.md) defined.

``` python
from ogc.spec import SpecLoader

app.spec = SpecLoader.load(["/Users/adam/specs/ogc.yml"])
```

To launch this node layout synchronously:

``` python
from ogc import actions

node_ids_created = [actions.launch(layout.as_dict()) for layout in app.spec.layouts]
```

For an asynchronous version:

``` python
from ogc import actions

node_ids_created = actions.launch_async(app.spec.layouts)
```

!!! info
    The naming conventions used for async functions is to append the suffix of `async` to the synchronous function name, for example, `actions.exec` and `actions.exec_async`.

### Script Deployment

Launching and deploying are separated into two parts, this allows for further customization between bringing up a machine and letting OGC handle the remaining deployment options.

To deploy the scripts defined in your specification, use the results from the previous launch of `node_ids_created`:

``` python
script_deploy_results = actions.deploy_async(node_ids_created)
```

### Checking Results

Checking the results of the deployment can be done in this way:

``` python
if all(result == True for result in script_deploy_results):
    print("Successfully deployed")
else:
    print("One or more deployments failed")
```
